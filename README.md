# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is an Android application that provides real-time weather information based on the user's current location or a specified city. The app leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data, including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and more.

The app features an intuitive UI with Edge-to-Edge support and adaptive system bar insets.
